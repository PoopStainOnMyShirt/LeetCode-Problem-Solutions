# 🥚 Joyojhyoty's LeetCode Solutions (The Journey Begins!)

This repository marks the start of my LeetCode journey!

I'm using a tool called **LeetSync** (or similar automation) to automatically track and commit my accepted solutions directly to this repository. This keeps my progress honest, version-controlled, and visible as I learn and grow.

## 🚀 The Mission

* **Goal:** To build a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.
* **Focus:** Gaining fluency in problem-solving and practicing efficient coding, primarily in **C#** and **Python**.
* **Starting Point:** Problem #1, one step at a time!

## 💡 What to Expect Here

Since I'm just getting started, you'll see a lot of "Easy" problems at first, as I focus on mastering the fundamentals.

| Directory | Content | Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `C-Sharp/` (or `C#`) | Solutions written in my primary language. | Leveraging my professional background in **C# / .NET** to write clean, efficient solutions. |
| `Python/` | Solutions for problems where Python is faster to prototype or required. | Focusing on algorithmic clarity. |
| `Problems/` | Markdown files automatically synced with the problem details. | Keeping notes on time/space complexity and tricky edge cases. |

## 📈 My Progress So Far

> **I'm just getting started! Check back soon to see my first solutions committed here.**

My focus right now is on:
1.  Understanding the problem thoroughly.
2.  Thinking through the **Time and Space Complexity** *before* coding.
3.  Writing clean, readable code.
